OUT iButtons were deployed with the intention to never be inundated by the river. IN iButtons were deployed with the intention to always be inundated by the river. In some cases rivers went dry during the deployment. The remaining five iButtons were intentionally deployed in variably inundated regions of sediment in a transect spanning Upstream and Upstream Mid-Point and Mid-Stream and Downstream Mid-Point and Downstream iButtons. A single Lat/Long is given for all sensors at a site, using the approximate mid point along the transect. Additional lat/long resolution is possible based on measured distances among sensors. See  iButton_Deployment_Protocol.pdf in the data package for more detail."
